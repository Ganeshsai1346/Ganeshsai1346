### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a front-end developer passionate about developing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces and apps. My tech stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and React. I am a motivated and cooperative person who learns and adapts to new situations quickly. I've spent a lot of time applying what I've learned about web development to scenarios and applications found in the real world as a result of my studies.

Technologies and tools I'm currently exploring and interested about.
